# Install via Cargo

The easiest way to install kakei if you already have Rust installed:

From the repository root:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

This installs `kakei` to your cargo bin directory (usually `~/.cargo/bin`).

Make sure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```
